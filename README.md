# Dialpad
1. The basic version of classic dialpad is similar to that of the one which we had in ourold phones with numbers and letters in the same keys.
2. On long pressing a button once, the number on it is printed. On single press, the first letter on the button is printed.
   On 2 quick successive presses, the second letter and on 3 quick successive presses, the third letter.
3. Clear button is there to clear the screen and backspace to erase one character.
