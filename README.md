# Dialpad
1. The basic version of classic dialpad is similar to that of the one which we got in old phones with numbers and letters in the same keys.
2. On long pressing a button one time the number on it is printed. On single press, the first letter on the button is printed.
   On 2 quick successive presses the second letter and on 3 quick successive presses the third letter.
3. Clear button is their to clear the screen and backspace to erase one character.
